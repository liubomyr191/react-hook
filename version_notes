1.2
---
- new directive 'log' outputs information about the current rendering context and any inputs
- lookups in scope chain fail only when property is not in the object at all, rather than when it is present but set to undefined
- allows for progressive rendering
  - dot access into undefined and null properties resolves to undefined, rather than erroring
  - the scope extension directives 'within', 'withinItem', and 'anchored' do not error when scope is undefined
  - withinItem passes if the top scope is not an array-like object

1.1.3
- any node substituted by a 'contain' directive does not inherit the containing scope chain, and is not recursed onto for an update operation

1.1.2 - cleanup and bug fixes
---
- Bugfix: In ie, react was iterating into loop templates. expando data properties were being copied, but now using jquery's .data() function
- Bugfix: In ie, react would error on trying to work with the object returned from querySelectorAll()
- Large under-the-hood revision to structure and readability
