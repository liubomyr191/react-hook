--- goals for next version ---
- don't recurse into widget nodes
- deprecate the .update() function
- provide .render() that anchors and associates all listeners
- when should listeners relink?

- loop item template must be labeled
- no loop items container node (all results get appended after template node)
- must declare a node as a react widget

--- random todos ---
- change queryselectorall to $.find() for compatibility
- Make lookups fail when property isn't defined on the object ('prop' in obj), rather than when it has a value of undefined
- Make a changed event on any numeric property of an array result in a changed event on the associated loop directives
- make every node in a loop listen to it's associated key
- remove update context?
- allow delayed updates that wait until a flag is turned on
- what if a listened-to property is stored somewhere up the prototype chain? how can listeners be registered there?
- add a jsonified output of any object in debug mode
- attrIf needs the same persistence behavior as classIf, write test for it first

--- write tests ---
- empty react attribute string doesnt break univers
- attributes should be removed if property is undefined, even after deletion
- when a within command fails lookup, the new scope is not added to the chain
