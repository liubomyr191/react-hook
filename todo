--- goals for next version ---
?- lookups no longer fail when they evaluate to undefined. Now they only fail when the key is not among the object, using the 'in' operator.
?- Allows for progressive rendering, by simply returning (rather than erroring) on lookup failure
?- don't recurse on nodes within contain directives

--- random todos ---
- Make lookups fail when property isn't defined on the object ('prop' in obj), rather than when it has a value of undefined
- Make a changed event on any numeric property of an array result in a changed event on the associated loop directives
- make every node in a loop listen to it's associated key
- remove update context?
- allow delayed updates that wait until a flag is turned on
- what if a listened-to property is stored somewhere up the prototype chain? how can listeners be registered there?
- add a jsonified output of any object in debug mode
- attrIf needs the same persistence behavior as classIf, write test for it first

--- write tests ---
- empty react attribute string doesnt break univers
- attributes should be removed if property is undefined, even after deletion
- when a within command fails lookup, the new scope is not added to the chain
